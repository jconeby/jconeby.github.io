- Very important for understanding PowerShell's pipeline

<br>


Below is an example of the Stop-Service cmdletâ€™s help file. It first states that it can accept pipeline input and 
that it will look at the property name of the object being inputted.

**DO NOT** run the script below. This will first create an object of the services running on a system then it 
will stop all services on a system.  The Stop-Service cmdlet is accepting the property names from the Get-Service cmdlet.

- Get-Service | Stop-Service
